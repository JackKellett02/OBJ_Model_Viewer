# OBJ_Model_Viewer
A model viewer for the .obj model type.
How to use this OBJ Model Renderer:

First of all you must open the executable file named “OBJModelRenderer.exe”.

When you open that executable file you will be faced with this command line interface. This
interface is open for the entire time the model viewer is open.

When you are at this point in the command line interface it is asking you to input the name of
a model to load.

A number of .obj models are provided in the “resource/models/” sub-directory of the model
viewer’s file as seen below.

Any models you wish to view must be located in the above folder.

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to have a model with textures please place it in a sub-directory, as below, in the
“models” folder. Then to load it, when you type in the model name, type the name of the
folder the textured model is placed in followed by a slash.

Using the model below for example when the model viewer asks for the model name type in:
“Model_C1102056/C1102056.obj”

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To load a model type in the name of said model into the program like below.

You must then give a value to scale a model versus it’s original size it was exported as. For
example giving it a scaling value of 1 to keep it the same size it was exported as.

Once that is complete, as shown above, the program attempts to load any material file and
then it loads all of the vertex data into the program and allows you to freely view the model.
